0490 Acting on config options left us in a broken state. Dying.
0491 You cannot set both DirServers and Alternate*Authority.
0492 You have used DirServer or AlternateDirAuthority to specify alternate directory authorities in your configuration. This is potentially dangerous: it can make you look different from all other Tor users, and hurt your anonymity. Even if you've specified the same authorities as Tor uses by default, the defaults could change in the future. Be sure you know what you're doing.

0552 You have a ControlListenAddress set to accept unauthenticated connections from a non-local address. This means that programs not running on your computer can reconfigure your Tor, without even having to guess a password. That's so bad that I'm closing your ControlPort for you. If you need to control your Tor remotely, try enabling authentication and using a tool like stunnel or ssh to encrypt remote access.
0553 You have a ControlListenAddress set to accept connections from a non-local address.  This means that programs not running on your computer can reconfigure your Tor. That's pretty bad, since the controller protocol isn't encrypted! Maybe you should just listen on 127.0.0.1 and use a tool like stunnel or ssh to encrypt remote connections to your control port.
0554 ControlPort is open, but no authentication method has been configured. This means that any program on your computer can reconfigure your Tor. That's bad! You should upgrade your Tor controller as soon as possible.

0589 We were compiled with headers from version %s of Libevent, but we're using a Libevent library that says it's version %s.
0590 This will almost certainly make Tor crash.
0591 If Tor crashes, this might be why.
0592 I think these versions are binary-compatible.
0593 It's a little hard to tell, but you seem to have Libevent 1.4.0-beta header files, whereas you have linked against Libevent %s.  This will probably make Tor crash.
0594 It's a little hard to tell, but you seem to have Libevent header file from 1.3e or earlier, whereas you have linked against Libevent %s.  This will probably make Tor crash.
0595 Initialized libevent version %s using method %s. Good.
0596 Initialized old libevent (version 1.0b or earlier). You have a *VERY* old version of libevent.  It is likely to be buggy; please build Tor with a more recent version.
0597 Libevent version %s often crashes when running a Tor server with %s. Please use the latest version of libevent (1.3b or later)
0598 There are serious bugs in using %s with libevent %s. Please use the latest version of libevent.
0599 There are minor bugs in using %s with libevent %s. You may want to use the latest version of libevent.

		1. Host a Hidden Service

	To start hosting a hidden service, start your server software that will host your hidden service and configure it to disable any settings that would cause it to reveal its real location (or, alternatively, you can intercept it). You start hosting a hidden service when you add it to the list of hidden services. Your service will be accessible through its associated .onion address (you may need to configure this .onion address in the server software you use).

		2. Host an Onion Router

	The OR network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more people who run relays, the faster the OR network will be. If you have at least 20 kilobytes/s each way, please help out by configuring Advanced Onion Router to be a relay too. To do this, you must enter a port for your relay (default port is 9050). You are hosting an onion router when directory servers have your address in the list they share for OR clients (they may not immediately update their lists with your service).
;
;	Private identity
;
2821 The following events will happen when you click "New identity":
2822 Generate new identity seeds used to randomize identity-specific information
2823 Identity-specific generators for HTTP headers and for nicknames use identity seeds to ensure constant values during identity life time.
2824 Close all connections and destroy all circuits
2825 Prevent mixing traffic that belongs to different identities.
2826 Expire all circuits
2827 Old circuits are no longer re-used for new connections.
2828 Expire temporary address maps (tracked hosts)
2829 Re-map all temporary address maps to new exits.
2830 Delete cookies saved by processes that had OR connections
2831 All processes that had HTTP OR connections and are still active are identified and their cookies and DOM storage (HTML5 cookies) are deleted.
2832 Delete Flash Player's cookies, local storage data and history
2833 Some websites may use some of Flash Player's features to track their visitors.
2834 Delete cookies stored by Microsoft Silverlight
2835 Silverlight cookies may also contain tracking information.
2836 Generate new Windows Media Player client ID
2837 Your Windows Media Player client ID is saved to AdvOR-undo.reg and the file is not overwritten. If some licensed material is no longer playable because of changing your unique ID, double click the .reg file to restore it.
;
;	Intercept
;
2838 Some applications have installed extensions / scripting languages that can be abused to bypass proxy restrictions to reveal your real IP. To make sure an application always uses its proxy settings, the application is intercepted and Winsock calls are redirected to AdvOR.dll.

		1. Quick Start
	"Quick Start" is a list of favorite programs that Advanced Onion Router can start and intercept at startup. Each program can have its own private sandboxing settings. All program-specific sandboxing restrictions apply, and all programs started from the "Quick Start" menus / command line / window cannot access any real information that is restricted by these settings.
	This is the "safe" way to start a program.

		2. Processes
	The list of processes allows a quick way to release an intercepted process and/or to intercept a program that was started before starting Advanced Onion Router, or a program that is allowed to have have non-OR network activities during the same session. While sandboxing restrictions apply, the program may already have some restricted information it got before these restrictions were applied and it may send restricted information through the OR network. If you are not sure the program doesn't leak any information that can be used to uniquely identify you, consider starting it via "Quick Start".

		3. Sandboxing
	Sandboxing restrictions are used when a new process is intercepted. When a program is added to the "Quick Start" list, current sandboxing options are saved as the default settings for intercepting that program. To change the settings for an existing "Quick Start" entry, remove the program from the "Quick Start" list, change sandboxing options and re-add it. When using the "Processes" window to intercept an existing process, current sandboxing settings are used.

2847 These settings are used when a new program is intercepted or added to the "Quick Start" list:
2848 "Local address" is the address a program gets when trying to get your local IP. Here you can enter any fake address or hostname.
2849 The difference between your local time and someone else's local time can be used to uniquely identify you. Enable this option to prevent intercepted programs from using your real local time.
2850 Fake IPs are within the 255.16.* range and are never sent through the OR network. Fake IPs are replaced with initial addresses when sending connection requests to exit nodes.
2851 Enable this option to make sure your real IP is not leaked when the program is using unsupported protocols.
2852 Use this option to always exclude exit nodes that are currenly used by other programs to make sure the same exit node cannot know what you do with 2 different programs or instances of the same program.
2853 When a program is intercepted its icon is changed by AdvOR.dll to help identifying intercepted processes.
